# gh_test
Test git functionality

This file has been created by github during 

# Master branch
This section is added from master branch.

To get back to the default branch (``master``), use the command

    git checkout master

Thus, ``checkout`` changes files in the current folder to the current state of correspondent branch. And the ``branch`` command creates a new branch.
